# Multimode Optical Waveguide Simulation

## Project Overview
In this project, an initial design and simulation of an on-chip optical waveguide were performed using the COMSOL Multiphysics simulation platform.

The work includes:
- The design and modeling of a photonic chip structure.
- Simulation of a Gaussian optical field at the waveguide input and visualization of the output field distribution.
- Observation of speckle pattern formation at the output, characteristic of a multimode optical waveguide.

## Geometry Description
The simulated structure represents a rectangular on-chip waveguide, including the core and cladding regions, designed for operation at a wavelength of 1550 nm.
